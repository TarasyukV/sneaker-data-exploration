## Project Overview

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 500 sneaker models to evaluate sales performance, revenue drivers, inventory efficiency, and seasonal demand patterns.

The objective is to identify top-performing models, assess operational risks such as damaged and unsold inventory, and understand how different editions and price segments impact overall profitability.

Data cleaning and transformation were performed in Power Query and PostgreSQL, and the final analytical dashboard was developed in Tableau to generate structured, business-oriented insights.
